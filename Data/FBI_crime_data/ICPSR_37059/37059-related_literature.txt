This report was produced by Westat, Inc., for BJS under award number 2017-
BJ-CX-K030. It builds upon a previously released report that combined data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with small area
estimation methods and data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports to produce
estimates for states for 1999–2013 and for some large counties and sub-
state areas for 1998–2012. This report features state-level estimates for
an expanded set of characteristics that have been produced as 3-year
averages for 2007–2018. The report includes displays of the state estimates
accompanied by a more simplified description for the interested public. The
majority of the report focuses on the software and its underlying methods.
